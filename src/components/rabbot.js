                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                  RABBOT is my MDes thesis project exploring the possibilities
                  of generating shared awareness in a virtual reality (VR)
                  experience between a head-mounted display (HMD) wearer and
                  other observers in the same physical space. The final outcome
                  of RABBOT features a modified VR head-mounted display and
                  three-player asymmetric mobile game experiences with an
                  embedded communication system to create opportunities for
                  shared awareness amongst players. In the game, the
                  participating observers can play cooperatively as Scientists
                  to against the HMD wearer who is playing the Rabbot. Overall
                  this thesis project argues that an engaging VR experience
                  should not focus exclusively on the HMD wearer but also
                  include other audiences to address and engage the
                  relationships and interactions between them.

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                  The isolating design of virtual reality (VR) head-mounted
                  displays (HMD) is typical in the single-player experience -
                  immersing one into a virtual environment. This often creates a
                  situation in which only one headset is available but no
                  opportunities for engagement are made accessible for other
                  people nearby. This isolation in VR cuts off social
                  connections and awareness between the virtual world and
                  physical world, between the HMD wearers and other observers.
                  Additionally, the current offerings in the consumer
                  electronics market of the head-mounted display have a dull
                  appearance, which also shows the lack of attention in terms of
                  design for other audiences.
