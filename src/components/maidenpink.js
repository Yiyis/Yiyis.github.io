                  The primary emotional cue of Maiden Pink is the relationship
                  between mother and daughter. The game starts with the player
                  being a little girl and traveling with her mother in a fantasy
                  world. The mother is always protecting her child and won’t let
                  the daughter away from her sight. However, the mother gets
                  injured seriously at the end of the first level and can’t keep
                  protecting the daughter through the journey, so the player as
                  a little girl needs to be independent and learn skills and
                  responsibility to save her mother. We all experienced the time
                  that always being protected by our parents and the moment we
                  have to learn to face the difficulties in life on our own.
                  Women especially experiencing tremendous growth in
                  independence. As the leading emotional cue reflects the life
                  experience, the aesthetic style also needs to be emphasized to
                  evoke the childhood memory and nostalgia emotion. Nostalgia
                  can appeal to the audience on a sentimental and emotive level.
                  Retro style graphics then becomes a more appropriate approach
                  to achieve our primary goal. My own practice and experiments
                  for our game Maiden Pink are trying different methods to
                  create artworks in a retro style that bring the
                  nostalgia-evoking stimuli. All the artworks for Maiden Pink
                  are created in very small resolution (25 X 25 pixels) to mock
                  the style of old games. Our artistic style are mostly inspired
                  by <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i>.
